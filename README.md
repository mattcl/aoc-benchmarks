# Comparative benchmarks for Advent of Code implementations

A collection of comparative benchmarks between different advent of code
solutions.

These are generated by a CI pipeline running on dedicated hardware, with the
goal of normalizing comparisons between different implementations by running
everything on the same hardware and against the same sets of inputs.
