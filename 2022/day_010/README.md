# Day 10 benchmarks

[link to problem](http://adventofcode.com/2022/day/10)

The following benchmarks are auto-generated via [hyperfine](https://github.com/sharkdp/hyperfine) by a ci system running on shared hardware. Results may be inaccurate, particularly for execution times < 5ms, as per the hyperfine warnings.

[ci pipeline](http://ci.papercode.net:8080/teams/aoc2022/pipelines/aoc-compare-2022)

The "official" inputs were aggregated from repositories participating in the generation of these benchmarks. The "challenge" inputs (if any) were sourced from various places, including the subreddit.
