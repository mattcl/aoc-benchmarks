# Day 4 benchmarks

[link to problem](https://adventofcode.com/2023/day/4)

The following benchmarks are auto-generated via
[hyperfine](https://github.com/sharkdp/hyperfine) by a CI system running on
dedicated hardware. As per the hyperfine documentation, results may be
inaccurate for times < 5 ms. These benchmarks represent the total time to read,
parse, and solve the given inputs, and, as such, some variation is expected due
to IO and other factors.
